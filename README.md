# DogbotMk1
<p>A simple, adorable dog-shaped robot that reads your emails.<p>

<p>DogbotMk1 uses the gmail API to get your emails, and then makes a call to the Microsoft Speech API to get a wav file of your email subject(s) being read. The result is a cute little high-pitched voice coming from a dog-shaped robot. Adorable!</p>

<p>The STLs in this repo are for the Dogbot insert, and contain a servo for moving the head, and a fan for cooling the Raspberry Pi.</p>
